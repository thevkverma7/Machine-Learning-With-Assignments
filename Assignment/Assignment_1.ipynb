    "Ans: I would use a reinforcement learning strategy. Reinforcement learning is a system in which a \"agent\" observes its surroundings, chooses and executes actions, and then receives a reward or punishment based on the outcome of the action. The agent develops the most productive strategy on its own over time."

    "Ans: A hyperparameter is a learning algorithm parameter, not a model parameter. For example, in a simple linear regression issue, theta, which is a vector of weights, is used to parameterize our model. We have a cost function that is run repeatedly using the gradient descent technique in order to discover the optimal values for theta. The learning rate of the method has a hyperparameter called alpha in gradient descent."

    "#### 13.What are the criteria that model-based learning algorithms look for? What is the most popular method they use to achieve success? What method do they use to make predictions?\n",
    "Ans: The ability to generalise to new cases is the objective of a model-based algorithm. Model-based algorithms achieve this by looking for the best values for the model's parameters, which are commonly referred to as theta. Machine learning is all about this seeking, or \"learning.\" Model-based systems learn by minimising a cost function that assesses how bad the system is at generating predictions on fresh data, plus a penalty for model complexity if the model is regularised, plus a penalty for model complexity if the model is not regularised. To construct a prediction, the characteristics of a new instance are supplied into a hypothesis function, which uses the lowest theta obtained by executing the cost function repeatedly."

    "A) collect additional data\n",

    "Ans: Cross-validation is a technique that allows you to compare models without having to use a separate validation set. It is preferable over validation set since it allows us to avoid breaking a portion of the training set in order to build a validation set, and having more data is always beneficial."
